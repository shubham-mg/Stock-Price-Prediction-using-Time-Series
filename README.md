# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Time-Series
### Developed time series models using statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices, including ARIMA, Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, GARCH, and LSTM neural networks.
### Performed time series analysis techniques like stationarity testing, decomposition, autocorrelation, and data preprocessing to understand and transform the data.
### Evaluated and compared the performance of different models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. LSTM neural network performed the best with lowest error.
